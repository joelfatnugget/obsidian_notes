- IoT refers to a global network of connected devices and the technology that enables communication both between the devices and with the Internet.
- 3 Main Elements on IoT: Things, Connectivity, Sense-Making. Focus is on connectivity.


### Week 1
#### Elements
1. Things:
**Things** refer to objects that are online, that are able to gather, send data and receive data. They are embedded with sensors to communicate with other objects. I.e. Smart Fridge, Thermostats, Industrial Devices

2. Connectivity
**Connectivity** refer to network technologies that allow devices to communicate and exchange data. This can be achieved through various technologies such as Wifi, Bluetooth, Thread, LoRaWAN, cellular networks and satellite communication. 

3. Sense-Making
**Sense-making**: Processing large amounts of data generated by IoT devices, transforming raw data into meaningful insights for decision-making. Think of a manufacturing plant, sensors on machines can decide whether a machine is going to fail or not. 

#### Applications
**Connected Cars**: Vehicles equipped with sensors that can collect data in multiple ways. â€“ Through Dashcam or infotainment systems
