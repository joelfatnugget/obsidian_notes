> [!IMPORTANT] What is the purpose of Small Group?

The purpose ties in very closely to how the idea of Small Groups were being formed. Any thoughts on how Small Groups were formed?
1. Acts 2:42-47
### The Fellowship of the Believers

42 And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. 43 And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and had all things in common. 45 And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. 46 And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.

This refers more to the body of the church. I.e. The whole youth or the whole church as a body. You are looking at thousands rather than just 10 or 20 people. So be very careful about context.

2. Jesus and his disciples
Jesus journeyed with his disciples. He walked with them, talked with them. He ate meals with them. 
The idea of a group comes together very clearly in this example. People come together and they consistently study and interact over Scriptures. They are committed to loving each other. But one thing I want to highlight, Jesus’ small group understood their mission and unfolded it together. As you step into this small group/Cell group, ask yourself what is your purpose and what is the mission that this cell group is trying to achieve?

Biblical Aspect – Unique to all Christians
### Hebrews 10:23 - 25
23 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. 24 And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, 25 not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
Hebrews 10:23-25

Small Groups are essential for practicing the faith, fostering spiritual growth, and encouraging one another.

### John Wesley – Unique to all Methodist
https://acsirevivals.wordpress.com/articles/the-holy-club/
Holy Club was an organisation at Christ, Oxford. Setup by brothers John and Charles Wesley in 1729. College students often scoffed at Methodist who tried to systematically serve God every hour of the day. They set aside time for praying, examining their spiritual lives, studying the Bible, and meeting together

Any idea why they were called the Holy Club?
- They were reaching out to prisoneres, helping the poor and providing education for local children. 
- You can see it as a continuation of the derogatory term called “Methodist”
- It wasn’t something that they came up with, but rather it was bestowed upon them
- They would also cover 22 questions of John Wesley’s Holy Club
	- Notice this. The 22 questions revolved around deep sharing about your own personal spiritual growth. To be able to confess your sins to one another. 
	- Accountability to one another
	- Commitment to grow his own spiritual life.

So if you see how John Wesley conducted his Holy Club session, it was very methodical and yet very soul searching and invigorating. You really needed to dig deep and engage with the topic and the questions at hand. It’s quite uncomfortable to be honest.

### Expectation of a Cell Group
What do you expect of a cell group? 
- Firm believer of what you put in, you will receive. How much you are open to sharing with one another, that’s how much you will receive!
	- Example is that of Testimony sharing, those of you who shared your testimony during Mission trip
	- Another Example: Sharing of struggles, to be honest and authentic with your struggles
- Some guidelines to set things into context
- https://youtu.be/K3xQTwjOWdk?list=PLpAhtsoRPC3bdIKiBbEIbA0fkLOa-rm-8&t=625
	- 4As:
		1. Authenticity in Relationship (How real were you with God’s people?)
		2. Authority of God’s Word (How do you see God’s word in your life? Do you recognise it’s power?)
		3. Acts of the Holy Spirit (How has the HS moved in ur week?)
		4. Accountability for Good Works (What kind of  )
- Do what is important to you
- To move you from a place of informational to transformational (Head knowledge to Heart Experience)
What will be different:
- Those leading ur YAM cell. You are not expected to always be better than the rest. See leadership as more of a administrative and facilitation role. Yes you have some authority also in the sense of reporting to the church. But never abuse it.
- Authenticity, it means as you go through CG, see your leaders as humans trying to figure it out in this world too. They are not perfect. Accept that they are going to be authentic and welcome it. 
- Move into taking ownership of your own journey and your own faith. Bring in your own lessons and teach others! If everyone can do that, your Cell Session will flourish.
