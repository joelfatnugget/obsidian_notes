Why Revelation?

- Begin with the end in mind.
- Revelation is not really about a destruction that will happen, but rather a marriage. A Wedding. A Beautiful thing that is to come.
- Ideas of a bridegroom, having a ceremony.
- The end is worship.
- But Who exactly is worthy of our worship?

Purpose:

- Heavenly perspective on our earthly circumstance

Think of it as trying to see things from God’s perspective. Heavenly perspective on an earthly circumstances. It can give hope or challenge you.

Apocalyptic Literature requires us to put in the hardwork. To really uncover and search our bibles. Good luck to those leading cell next few weeks.


When you watch this does it not feel like something similar to that of Noah and the Ark? God destroys the whole earth, and then he allows the earth to kind of reset. It is slightly different in Revelation because God allows his people to destroy themselves from the inside out.

- Hard reset and then something beautiful comes out of it.

Isaiah,

Apostle Paul → Apocalytic experience that gives people a heaven perspective on their earthly situation → Hope or Challenge you

Extended Apocalyptic dreams or visions. → Apocalyptic Literature

Daniel → Ferocious beasts coming up out of a dark sea, trampling people on the land. Then a character called the Son of Man is exalted to rule the world.

Apocalyptic literature is written in a poetic, imaginative style

2. What type of Biblical book is this?
Revelation is a triple-genre piece of writing. 
- Apocalypse! Catastrophe. 
- Characteristics of the apocalyptic genre include:
		o Unveils divine mysteries or an unseen reality, via symbolic visions, dreams, or heavenly journeys
		o The visions are often highly dramatic and cataclysmic 
		o There is frequently an eschatological (end-times) emphasis
		o Sometimes, a heavenly figure is present as a guide-interpreter
		o Often make connection between heavenly-and-earthly realities, as well as present-and- future realities
		o Often showcase the sovereignty and cosmic power of God
-  Apart from the book of Revelation, portions of Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah, Matthew display characteristics of the apocalyptic genre.
- We modern readers are quite unfamiliar with the apocalyptic genre. Thus, we should make the effort to read these other apocalyptic passages in the Bible, so as to get a better grasp of the symbolism and meaning of the book of Revelation.
- Letter
	- This is 1 Letter to be circulated to 7 different churches. If anything it is an important letter. Think of alignment of the 7 different churches. Have you ever wondered… the church today is so divergent and fragmented, whether it is in terms of reading the word or coming to certain conclusions. Yet in revelation it talks about aligning the 7 churches. For all Christians to align. Notice the tension on both ends. Reality is that different churches and people have different interpretations and yet the book of revelation was meant to unite and bring alignment to ALL Christians.
	- 
- Prophecy
	- Both foretelling and forth-telling 
	- Future and present
	- Response in the future and now even in the present
Not written only for the final generation
Consider historical situation of the first-hearers
A call for a response of faith in every generation

**Implications of triple-genre**
**Rather, Revelation is a call for a response of faith in and by every generation. Its topics and themes will also not be entirely unfamiliar or distant from the lived situations of its first recipients (characteristic of prophetic, letter).**


What is the point of this Biblical Book?
- Major Themes:
	- Cosmic and Universal Sovereignty and Power of God, who creates and renews his Creation
	- Sovereign God is not disinterested in his Creation, but deeply involved and personally active in human affairs, including death and resurrection of the Lamb
	- A Call to faithfulness and worship by God’s people, even amid great trouble and persecution
	- Certainty of judgement for those who do not give worship to the King
	- Certain of Victory, defeat of evil and fruitfully abundant life for followers of the lamb
- In this sermon series that the Church is embarking… they chose to go in from the angle of “Who is worthy of our worship?”


Read Revelation with humility
- We don’t need to know every single detail about revelation
- but big picture themes are important
- End goal of a wedding and a worship, victory of the lamb of God, the justice of God’s righteous judgements → Are clear!
- Don’t be too dogmatic about certain things!


The end goal of revelation: Personally is not to be afraid of Revelation but to highlight the seriousness of Sin in the presence of God. To open up my eyes to see God’s just judgements and to call us to repentance before it is too late. 
Persecution of God’s people (Not from punishing his people, but simply because we bear the name)

Pastor G goes on to talk about how at the end of revelation it is a call to worship. It is a call to live out lives better, to be more present. To allow worship to overflow. 

Worship is both the deep response of each individual, and the common cry of a vast multitude.
The impression I have of revelation now is that where the whole church comes together to worship and to praise God. Not just with our words and the songs we sing, but with our actions. With our hands and our feet, with the things we do to one another and to those who are not in our church.
