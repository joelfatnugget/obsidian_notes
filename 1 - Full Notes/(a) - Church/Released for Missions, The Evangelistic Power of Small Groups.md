# Acts 2:44 - 47 (ESV)
### The Fellowship of the Believers
*42 And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. 43 And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and had all things in common. 45 And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. 46 And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.*

Context:
- Days of the early church
- They focused on growing the church as a body of Christ
- Awe came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles
- "They were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need."

Learning Points:
- They sold as per when they needed. They didn't just sell recklessly. They heard the cries and the needs of those around them, they contributed generously.
- As youths what are your resources? perhaps it's inherited wealth from your parents. Perhaps it's time and resources! Or even perhaps it's more of Energy! 
- Have you ever wondered you as a young teen in SG, what made you so special to be able to afford education? Perhaps even an education here at ACS
	- How fortunate are we that we are able to receive so much from God? Yet what are we worried about? Grades? Not getting to eat ramen for lunch? 
	- It's not about selling everything, but merely it's about being a catalyst for change. Much has been given and much will be expected.



# Hebrews 10:24 - 25
### The Full Assurance of Faith

19 Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, 20 by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, 21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. 24 And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, 25 not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.

# John 17:21
20 “I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, 21 that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
