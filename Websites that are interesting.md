Marc Andreessen talks about the importance of chasing opportunities and being aware of the opportunities that present itself. If given the chance to jump ship and join a company that is overseas and requires you to move, do it. Always look for opportunities, because if you don’t take it, someone else will take it and you will be left in the dust. 

My takeaway: Never be ashamed of taking opportunities. It should always be something you work towards. 

What then am I to do now in my current state: 
- I am graduating SMU in a couple of months and will be looking to start work. 
But that does not mean that I am done learning and growing, in fact Marc believes that the most important thing is to maximise the impact I will have on the world. This is done by continuously developing and broadening my base of skills. 

**SEEK to be a double/triple/quadruple threat.**
That means 
1. Become the best at 1 specific thing. 
2. Become very good at 2 or more things.
Question is then what is this 1 specific thing? 

Get a Degree in Business on top of my engineering degree. That is so important and crucial. I need to know how to combine these two knowledge and domains together. 

Find a MBA. Or a Law Degree. Can you do a part time law degree?

**5 Skills to work on upon leaving school**
1. Communication
Be good public speakers! Practice Practice and Practice. Be very good at public speaking. At least 1 skill in my mix should be communication, either written or verbal. But since I’m bad at written communication, let’s go down the verbal path! 
Be good in giving Presentations. DO NOT Think too highly of yourself, but always practice and practice. 

If you are able to communicate while also understanding the technical aspects of it, you will excel.

>”An engineer or a finance person or a lawyer who can communicate is hugely more valuable than one who cannot”

2. Management
Learn how to manage people well. [Question to ask Zhi Min, what makes a good manager?]
Ask her to teach you how to do it.  Learn more about how to manage people well. This is important, you will know a good manager when you see it. 

3. Sales
Sell well. Not just selling equipment but rather learn how to convince people that something is in their best interest to do, even when they don’t realise it up front. (Does this change quite dramatically with the younger generation?)

The art of being able to interact with people such that they will do what you want, predictably and repeatedly, as long as you are making sense and offering them something they should want.
